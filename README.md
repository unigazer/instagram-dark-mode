The UserCSS will add the look and feel of a dark mode on Instagram.

This will restore the Instagram layout to normal state before the complete disaster with the new layout.
The code is incredibly low quality and the DOM looks like a toddler wrote the update for the new Instagram layout.
While inspecting the DOM, I've found a lots of garbage HTML nodes, hidden form elements that have no purpose and
multiple empty divs' that have no purpose are not being used.
